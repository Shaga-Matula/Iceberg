# Introduction

### Iceburg is a game of cunning and guile for one player. The object of the game is to destroy 3 Icebergs to clear a path for your ship to cross, but! Its fogy and you cannot see, fortunately the sea is flat as a pancake and you can hear the sound of dripping water as the icebergs melt, 'It’s so quiet' you hear the first mate say, 'its so quiet'.
&nbsp;
### Use this tranquility to your advantage, your crew will listen out for the sound of ice crushing under the weight your torpedoes as you hunt in the fog for the ICEBERGS
&nbsp;
### You can achieve your goal by selecting Coordinates to launch your torpedoes into the foggy night.Firstly select a letter from the top row of A to J. Then insert a colon : to separate letters from numbers. After the colon you can select a number from 01 to 20
&nbsp;
### Please note the input must be 4 char long. 
&nbsp;
### An example of this would be B:02, for Column b row 2. If you choose a row number under 10 it must be preceded with a 0. An example of this for Column h row 2, would be H:02. 
&nbsp;
### Iceburgs are huge and 90% is hidden underwater, so you will need hit it dead centre to destroy the Iceberg. Thus you may hit outside of the Iceberg before you can hit its center. If so the computer will display a 1, if it’s a miss you get a 0. Icebergs take up 9 spaces, X in middle, surounded by 1's 
&nbsp;
### The game is over when you sink all 3 Icebergs or quit game. Good luck captain and God Speed!

## Project Goals 
The project goal is to create a logic game using Python.

### User Goals

The application user wants to play a logic game.

### Site Owner Goals
The Battleships game is played on grids on which each player's fleet of battleships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players call shots at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
The application provides a working battleships game for a single user to play against the computer.

## User Experience

### Target Audience
- Younger users who like playing games.
- Users who are looking for a game to pass time on during a break.
- Older users who are looking for a logic challenge.

### User Requirements and Expectations

### User Stories
1. To create a personal username.
2. To be able to return to the game with my username and password.
3. To have an immersive experience.
4. To have real-time feedback when playing the game.
5. To be able to play the game against a computer opponent.
6. To be told when the game has been won or lost.
7. To be able to easily replay the game if wanted.

### Data Modelling
- The data stored in the Google Spreadsheet is a combination of a username and password entered by the user on the login page.

- A new user will enter their choice of username and password which will be stored in the spreadsheet 'user_data_sheet' in the worksheet 'username'. Their password will be stored in the same spreadsheet but in the 'password' worksheet.

- A returning user will type in their username, the function will check the 'username' worksheet for a matching value and return a welcome message if true. The user will be prompted for a password and the function will, once again, check the 'password' worksheet for a matching value. If the function returns both inputs then the user will be allowed to play the game.

- If the returning user inputs do not match, the user will be taken to the start of the login function where they can try again or enter a new set of credentials.


## Technologies Used

### Languages
- Python 3

### Frameworks & Tools
- LucidChart
- Heroku
- Google Drive: Used as a cloud hosting platform for the spreadsheet.
- Google Spreadsheet: Used because Python does not have a built in library to store data in an external spreadsheet.
- pycodestyle: Used as a validation tool instead of pep8 online.
- gitHub
- Gitpod
- Git

## Validation

### PEP8 validation
At the time of creation, the PEP8 online Python validation website was inoperative. To validate the code, a PEP8 validator that is built into the GitPod Workspace was used.

1. Run the command 'pip3 install pycodestyle'. (Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.)
2. In the workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type the word 'linter' into the search bar that appears. 
4. Click on 'Python: Select Linter' from the filtered results.
5. Select 'pycodestyle' from the list.
6. PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside the terminal.

There were no errors or warnings flagged in login.py.
There were no errors or warnings flagged in test_login.py
15 yellow warnings were flagged in run.py. These are down to the symbol combinations used in the ASCII art and logo. These are printed direct to the console and not used in any functions.

## Deployment
Use the following steps to deploy the poject to Heroku:
1. Use the "pip freeze -> requiremnts.txt" command in the gitPod terminal; to save any libraries that need to be installed to the project files in Heroku.
2. Login or create a Heroku account.
3. Click the "New" button in the upper right corner and select "Create New App".
4. Choose an app name and your region and click "Create App". Note: the app name must be unique.
5. Go to the "Settings" tab, add the python build pack and then the node.js build pack. This is to ensure the project functions correctly with the Code Institute pre-installed template.
6. Create a "Config VAR" with the 'CREDS' key and the enter the value of the creds.json file.
7. Create a second "Config VAR" with the key of 'PORT' and value of '8000'
8. Go to the "Deploy" tab and pick GitHub as a deployment method.
9. Search for a repository to connect to.
10. Click enable automatic deploys and then deploy branch.
11. Wait for the app to build and then click on the "View" link.

You can fork the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right-hand corner.

You can clone the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it.
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone and paste the URL from the clipboard ($ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY).
